# have a suitable wrapper, can refind Boost here, e.g.
# find_package(Boost @Boost_VERSION@ EXACT REQUIRED)
# CMake does provide a find_dependency module, but that doesn't
# seem to work so well with imported targets created in FindXXX
# modules. Also, not that the package *does not* need to be refound
# if it's a *private* and *shared lib only* dependency (i.e. no
# headers appear in out package's public interface)
